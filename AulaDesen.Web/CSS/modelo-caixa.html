    <h2 class="titulo">Moon in 2024: NASA Taps 11 U.S. Companies to Advance Human Lunar Landers </h2>

    <p>
    NASA has selected 11 companies to conduct studies and produce prototypes of human landers for its Artemis lunar exploration program. 
    This effort will help put American astronauts — the first woman and next man — on the Moon’s south pole by 2024 and establish sustainable
    missions by 2028.
    The mission is named Artemis after the Greek goddess of the Moon and twin sister of Apollo. On May 13,
    the White House submitted an amendment to the FY 2020 budget request to help NASA implement a sustainable, 
    open, long-term program of lunar exploration. Find out more from our Moon to Mars feature.
